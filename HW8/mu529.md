## Clarity
There seems to be a kink in the data around 1995. It is difficult to see what the behavior of the two data sets are after this time since the two data sets also appear to cross at this point. Larger symbols might make this easier to see. The gray dashes also muddle the data and should be lighter, solid, or removed altogether. The axis labels are a little small and should be enlarged. There's enough room to spell out "Average square feet," which would make this more accessable to readers not as familiar with feet or the abbreviation "sq ft".

## Aesthetic
The red color desaturates under Protonopia and Deuteranopia, which then blends in with the dark blue. Changing one or both colors may be helpful. The plot is not particularly rich, and more data could be added. There are some obvious trends here, so adding a regression line or curve is warranted. The plot gives no indication of how many units make up each point; perhaps this can be represented by varying the size of the points.

## Honesty
It may be worth investigating if the high-valued points prior to 1920 are outliers. It is driving the y-range and influences the intuition that these may be quadratic (not linear) relationships. If the number of units driving the calculation of these points is very small (see above) removing them may tell a different story.
