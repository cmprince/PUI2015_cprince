## Clarity
There seems to be a kink in the data around 1995. It is difficult to see what the behavior of the two data sets are after this time since the two data sets also appear to cross at this point. Larger symbols might make this easier to see. The gray dashes also muddle the data and should be lighter, solid, or removed altogether. The axis labels are a little small and should be enlarged. There's enough room to spell out "Average square feet," which would make this more accessable to readers not as familiar with feet or the abbreviation "sq ft".
