## Clarity
The plot is small, so the elements are difficult to read, despite the fact that there aren't many of them in the plot area. Moving the legend inside the plot area would help use the space more efficiently. The y-axis does not indicate units. The y-axis tick labels could be expressed in millions (of whatever unit) to make it more readable. There are more y-axis divisions than data points, so this should be reduced. The x-axis says "buildings reporting"--reporting what, and from where?

## Aesthetic
The colors are not particularly attractive, but they remain decently contrastive across color blind tests. There is a lot of empty space in the plot, indicating there may be room for additional variables to be represented.

## Honesty
What is the question that is to be answered? The title of the plot asks "Does building GHG intensity vary by borough?" The data indicates that it does not (at least not by much), but that's indicated by an increasing relationship! Dividing by the number of buildings would normalize the data and show the data along a constant y-value. This is a more intuitive way to answer the question. This would also allow the data to be presented in a simpler bar chart format.

The p-value for the linear fit must be enormous! There is not enough data for this to be a reliable predictive tool, so it should be removed.
