very good reviews (even of my plot although i stand by the legend font size, and large font sizes in general)

10/10


 NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
====================
very nice and clear, despite the large amount of info displayed

the rainbow color scheme is never advised as it induces to see structure where there is none

the white label subscriber is hard to read

the yellow bins are good for separating the hour chunks but are not in the label leading to confusion

the 5 categories plotted as lines are actually 2 types of categories: they should be displayed with different lines (dashed and solid) and the line thickness generally adds to clutter but is not needed

missing y label at the top, but the title explains enough. maybe use smaller numbers by plotting in units of 10,000



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===============================

======

missing x label

y label too small

size of points is unexplained

the large number of points causes crowdedness and ibstruction. consider contour plots instead where the density of points is too high

=====
interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant

Rbc2pt0
========

the 2 points default in the legend should he substituted by a single plot as it is redundant and with large points it overlaps

missing units on x and y axis


the y tick labels should be in a more compressed readable notation, e.g. change units to millions


the empty space in the plot is distracting and does not help comparison (remember tufte's rules) 

the point size is unexplained

the color of Bk and Bx is indistinguishable at first sight

the legend shows "dot size reflects..." which belongs in a separate label, not in the legend, and it confuses the association of the blue color to SI.

size differential too large
