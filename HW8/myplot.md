*because I'm my own worst critic*

## Clarity
Why are the bars colored differently? There does not appear to be any difference in their treatment. The labels on the 2D histograms are difficult to read. They might be rotated 90 degrees for better contrast. The y-axis tick labels run into the plot areas and need to be adjusted.

## Aesthetic
What beauty! This is obviously the work of someone with a well-trained eye for effective visual communication!

## Honesty
It is evident that the "unknown" and "customer" groups are nearly identical. This makes the unknown line in the top plot redundant and should be removed.
