## Clarity
The plot is missing x-axis labels and ticks, and there is no notation to indicate what the bubble size
represents, so we can only guess what the x-axis might represent from the title of the plot. There is not a lot
of contrast in the bulk of the bubbles; is it strictly necessary to plot the color on a continuous range? Bucketing
by ranges (e.g., decades) and recoloring across the entire spectrum may help make any temporal relationships
more visible.

## Aesthetic
The green color scale is difficult to discern since it appears that the bulk of the data lies at the darker end of
the scale. There is overlap, so using color to indicate the year means that alpha cannot be used to see points
underneath other points. I can identify four separate populations: a left population, a right population, a population
with small bubbles, and a population with larger bubbles. Breaking these into subplots *may* add some insight. The left
and right populations in particular would be good candidates for applying linear fits since there appears to be
a relationship between the x- and y-variables.

## Honesty
There are two points along $y = 10^0$, which reminds me that this data comes from the PLUTO data set. I can then
infer that these points must come from lots in that data set, not zip codes, community districts or other municipal
divisions. This should be noted somewhere in the plot, probably the title.
