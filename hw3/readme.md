The first notebook is my own work, although some code was derived from the lecture material. The second notebook is derived explicitly from Dr. Bianco's template.

These notebooks only require standard libraries, plus `numpy` and `pylab`. Because I did not have access to the image files in the second notebook, those cells appear to be executed out-of-order, but were in fact were never executed during development (that is, they were kept as-is from the source material). The cells containing these commands were commented out, and I kept calls to `json`, `sys` and `os` libraries so that the images and plot defaults can be loaded at a later date.
