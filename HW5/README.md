*or, why won't this $%^# run...*

It wasn't that bad in the end, but it did take me a while. I wanted to do
some more beautiful coding, but I couldn't get some of my masks to work the
way I wanted them to, so I reverted to for loops. I also seem to be memory
limited, so I tried some tricks to free up space, but shapefiles are...
challenging.

I don't think I've used any packages the graders won't already have. The zipped
PLUTO data must be in a directory placed or linked to from $PUI2015/data/pluto.

Energy data is used directly from the opendata portal.

Income data is used directly from cosmo.nyu.edu.

I've left some of my aborted attempts at elegance since I hope to come back to
them (I *will* defeat pandas!) so if you have any comments or suggestions I
would appreciate it.

All work was done by me, using Dr. Bianco's templates and some hints from
StackExchange (all heavily modified).
